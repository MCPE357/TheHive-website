This is a long post, so grab a drink, put on some music, and dive in!</p><p>Treasure Wars was first coded in August of 2018. That means it&apos;s now over five years old! And... we think it shows. So, we believe it&apos;s time for a change... a change that rejuvenates the game and gets people excited about the genre again.</p><p>Today, we&apos;re announcing that in the coming months, we&apos;ll be putting Treasure Wars to sleep and releasing a brand new game in it&apos;s place: BedWars.</p><p>BedWars will be the Treasure Wars you know and love at its core, but rethought for 2023. With new maps, items, UI, and features - we hope Hive BedWars will be the best BedWars available on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.</p><h3 id="bedwars">BedWars?</h3><p>We understand this might shock some of you and maybe even seem like a confusing decision. So, with the aim of full transparency, we&apos;re going to explain our reasons as to why we&apos;ll be renaming our oldest game.</p><p>Treasure Wars is just our version of BedWars. However, that isn&apos;t clear to new players.</p><p>Our support team gets tickets every week asking us to add BedWars. The name is unnecessarily confusing, and we&apos;re fighting with that pre-existing knowledge of the Minecraft community. This confusion is even greater for non-English speakers.</p><p>We also believe this will benefit our awesome creator community. We hope it will help creators gain new viewers familiar with BedWars content and help them with traffic from related videos.</p><p>The new name also helps let players know it&apos;s brand new! Players are likelier to check out the server when they see BedWars than if they were to see Treasure Wars: Seasons. </p><h3 id="bedwars-features">BedWars Features</h3><p>Treasure Wars is still in the DNA of Hive BedWars, but we&apos;re designing it to have much more depth and replayability. </p><p>We&apos;ll talk much more about the new features soon, but as an overview, here&apos;s a list of some of the features you&apos;ll see with the launch of BedWars.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x26A0;&#xFE0F;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">BedWars is still in development, and these features are subject to change pending feedback from our testing sessions.</div></div><ul><li><strong>Seasons:</strong><br>BedWars will have seasons from day 1. We hope each season will bring new excitement to the game.</li><li><strong>Challenges:</strong><br>Seasonal quests that grant you challenge medals. These medals can be spent in the BedWars Microhub for special rewards.</li><li><strong>BedWars Microhub:</strong><br>A hub dedicated to BedWars. Easy access to your locker and a new challenge merchant.</li><li><strong>Redesigned generators (previously summoners):</strong><br>Upgrade your island generator to generate other currencies.</li><li><strong>Team Upgrades:</strong><br>Invest in special upgrades with varying functionality.</li><li><strong>New Maps:</strong><br>7 brand new maps and improvements to current maps.</li><li><strong>Damage Indicators:</strong><br>See the health of enemies you are in combat with.</li><li><strong>New Items:</strong><br>Many new items provide different ways to play the game.</li><li><strong>Improved Shop UI:</strong><br>Making it easier to browse and buy items.</li><li><strong>All new cosmetics:</strong><br>Completely reworked cosmetics for the BedWars theme.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/map-p.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" alt="Let&apos;s Talk About Treasure Wars" srcset="https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/map-p.jpg 600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/map-p.jpg 1000w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/map-p.jpg 1600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/map-p.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/map-r.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" alt="Let&apos;s Talk About Treasure Wars" srcset="https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/map-r.jpg 600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/map-r.jpg 1000w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/map-r.jpg 1600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/map-r.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Two of the 7 new maps that will launch with BedWars</figcaption></figure><h3 id="treasure-wars-stats">Treasure Wars Stats</h3><p>BedWars will have new leaderboards. We believe this is the fairest approach. It&apos;s a fresh start for all. We&apos;re excited to see who will take the top spots!</p><p>This means your Treasure Wars stats and unlocks will not transfer to BedWars.</p><p>Any unlocks given as part of a special event, or part of a paid bundle will have an equivalent BedWars unlock given to you for free. All global unlocks (costumes, avatars, hub titles) will remain, but will no longer be acquirable.</p><p>However, the Treasure Wars leaderboards/stats will be available indefinitely and will continue to appear on our website and in-game leaderboard browser.</p><p>We&apos;ve also worked on some super special rewards that will be granted to Treasure Wars players when BedWars releases:</p><ul><li><strong>Emerald Treasure Hat:</strong><br>Granted to the top 1,000 players of this year.</li><li><strong>Diamond Treasure Hat:</strong><br>Granted to the top 10,000 players of this year.</li><li><strong>Gold Treasure Hat:</strong><br>Granted to the top 100,000 players of this year.</li><li><strong>Level Hub Title:</strong><br>All players will be granted a special hub title that shows their final Treasure Wars level (including prestige).</li><li><strong>Veteran Hub Title:</strong><br>All players will be granted a special hub title showing how many years they have played Treasure Wars (calculated based on the account&apos;s first game).</li></ul><p>&quot;This year&quot; refers to a leaderboard that collates all stats from January 1st, 2023 to September 1st, 2023.</p><p><strong>Update!</strong> For those top-tier prestige players, we&apos;ll grant you 10 one-hour xp boosters for each prestige level. That means if you&apos;re prestige 5, you&apos;ll get 50 boosters for free. This means we&apos;ll be giving away over $125,000 worth of boosters. These boosters will be granted when BedWars releases.</p><p>Level 100 players that have not prestiged will also get 10 boosters.</p><h3 id="when-can-i-play">When can I play?</h3><p>This is why Treasure Wars: Seasons hasn&apos;t been released yet. We realized during development that the game needed (and deserved) much more love - resulting in this new plan.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/beds.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Let&apos;s Talk About Treasure Wars" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="768" srcset="https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/beds.jpg 600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/beds.jpg 1000w, https://playhive.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/beds.jpg 1600w, https://playhive.com/content/images/2023/09/beds.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Unlock new frames, pillows, bed sheets, and toppers!</figcaption></figure><p>We&apos;re disappointed we didn&apos;t meet our summer release, but we hope you can appreciate why. We&apos;ll continue to be as transparent as we can regarding server development.</p><p>When can you expect to get your blocky hands-on Hive BedWars? Well, we&apos;re working on it right now. Our current order of releases is as follows:</p><ul><li>Murder Mystery Map Update</li><li>SkyWars Microhub (with SkyRoyale LTM)</li><li>BedWars (formerly <s>Twitter</s> Treasure Wars: Seasons)</li><li>SkyWars: More Kits Update</li></ul><p>Although there&apos;s no concrete date, we&apos;re working through updates fast.
