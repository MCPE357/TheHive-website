All this content released with the Sonic update came to an epic conclusion with our biggest live event yet: a vast, interactive spectacle in which all participating players helped defeat Eggman and his many badniks. With all 3 live events pulling in over 55,000 participants, in total over 150,000 of our players experienced this once-in-a-lifetime display.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDGOk53rJ2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Not only did the Sonic event allow us to work with (and on!) much-beloved video game characters, it also helped elevate The Hive to the next level.

Alongside the Easter update, we also released the BlockDrop minigame, a well-received game that will return in 2022.</p><p>The first post-summer hub was our Autumn Hub, followed soon by the Halloween hub in late October.

Throughout 2021, we developed a fully-fledged replay system. Thanks to this, our staff can moderate our network much more efficiently, and we no longer have to rely on player evidence submissions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../../content/images/2022/01/replay.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="../../../../content/images/size/w600/2022/01/replay.jpg 600w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/replay.jpg 1000w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/replay.jpg 1600w, ../../../../content/images/2022/01/replay.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Lights.

In late 2021 the replay system was released as a paid addon, allowing players infinite access to the system for their own (creative) use cases!</p><h3 id="game-updates">Game Updates</h3><p>Last but not least, we released a long list of game updates throughout 2021. Let's take a look at some of the highlights:</p><p>Survival Games received a massive overhaul in February, bringing new maps, features, and even custom items to the game.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../../content/images/2022/01/void-walker.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="../../../../content/images/size/w600/2022/01/void-walker.jpg 600w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/void-walker.jpg 1000w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/void-walker.jpg 1600w, ../../../../content/images/2022/01/void-walker.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>SkyWars Kits NPC</figcaption></figure><p>SkyWars throughout the year received much attention: from various balancing and item updates coming out early in the year, to the Mega and Kits modes coming out later in the year.</p><p>Treasure Wars received two major updates: one to bring it to level 100, and a further one that introduced the concept of prestiging alongside new items, win streaks, and maps.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../../content/images/2022/01/prestige.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="../../../../content/images/size/w600/2022/01/prestige.jpg 600w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/prestige.jpg 1000w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/prestige.jpg 1600w, ../../../../content/images/2022/01/prestige.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The prestige animation.</figcaption></figure><p>Hide and Seek got a level update to level 50, alongside many quality of life changes and maps.</p><p>Custom Servers for all games received a major overhaul, improving menus and functionality, as well as adding tons of new options to most games. We also increased the discoverability of custom servers by adding a button to all game selectors.</p><h2 id="looking-forward-to-2022">Looking forward to 2022</h2><p>Despite plenty of updates and long-lasting features, in 2021 a lot of our focus went into creating seasonal- and temporary content. We're insanely proud of the work that went into the Sonic and other events, but we're turning things around in 2022: a hard focus on permanent content.</p><p><strong>Before you read on</strong>: please note that we aren't committing to public release dates for any of the following. They reflect our internal timelines, but we will always continue to only release content we deem is good and finished.</p><p>For our creative and game teams, our biggest focus is on our next release: a jam-packed arcade that appeals to many different kinds of players. Games such as Ground Wars and BlockDrop will become permanent arcade games and will be introduced alongside never-seen-before games.</p><p>Our backend teams will be working on in-game reporting, which will be fully tied into our Replay system. Furthermore, we will be making changes to our matchmaking and decoupling regions from it: that is, when you join The Hive in the middle of the night in Europe, you won't join empty lobbies anymore. As a desired side effect, this will also cause Platform Based Matchmaking to be enabled for longer.</p><p>Additionally, the backend teams are also working towards a complete social-system overhaul.</p><p>In 2021, we doubled our investment in anti-cheat solutions. Whilst we don't provide details on this, we will continue to improve the anti-cheat throughout 2022.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../../../../content/images/2022/01/mounts.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="../../../../content/images/size/w600/2022/01/mounts.jpg 600w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/mounts.jpg 1000w, ../../../../content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/mounts.jpg 1600w, ../../../../content/images/2022/01/mounts.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>A sneak peek at one of the WIP mounts!</figcaption></figure><p>Pets and mounts will also release this year, starting with our first pet around January 15th: Cubee Pet, available exclusively by purchasing <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/cubee-plush?ref=playhive.com">Cubee Plush</a>. Further pets will release sometime throughout this year.</p><p>We're very excited about all we plan to bring to you this year.
